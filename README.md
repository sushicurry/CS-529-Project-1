# CS-529-Project-1
Description given on this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs529project1-2022/data

A project where a decision tree was created to based on training data that would be able to classify 60 nucleotide-long DNA sequences as N, EI, IE based on the type of split they represent. This program was done in C++ for fun. As a note this project uses boost libraries for running a chi square test. The project contains three header files - Data.h, Node.h and Tree.h. Data.h contains a namespace data containing various functions that were used in reading data from file, writing data to file, as well as various functions that were used to get information necessary for construction of our tree. Node.h contains the Node class that represents a node in our tree. This is where we found what the best split for the data in said node, a label and pointers to child nodes. Tree.h contains the Tree class. It currently only has functions implemented to construct the tree by reading data from train.csv and using the best splits in the Node class as well as the predict function reading sequences from the test.csv file to then classify based on our tree.
